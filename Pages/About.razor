<MudText Class="mb-8">
    My name is <i>DAM Quang Trung</i>, a.k.a. Damien DAM. I was born a Vietnamese 🇻🇳 and now also a French 🇫🇷 national,
    so I speak fluently both languages as well as English 🇬🇧 since I had also spent a few years in the United States 🇺🇸
    for my undergrad studies.

<MudText Class="mb-8">
    I have been passionate about coding 💻 since I was 13 years old but then stop pursuing it for personal reasons. During
    the time in the US and most of the years in France I didn't at all touch a single line of code until recently.
    The fact that I was able to pick up coding again excites me everyday 🤘🤘🤘.

<MudText Class="mb-8">
    My programming languages of choice are Python, C#, C and C++.

<MudText Class="mb-8">
    Although still working professionally in the kitchen (I studied French cuisine 🍳🥐), I'm looking forward to going back
    to school and study every bit of knowledge about coding and computer science.

<MudText Class="mb-8">
    I'm very excited and can't wait for my <i>Piscine</i> at <MudLink Href="https://www.42.fr/">Ecole 42 Paris</MudLink>
    to start this March. This is an intensive month of coding where prospective students at the school have to code 7/7
    for 18~ hours a day during 4 weeks. Although right now I'm still undecided about whether I want to go to this school
    for 2 years or to go to a good Master of Computer Science, I'm still very much looking forward to these weeks to come.
