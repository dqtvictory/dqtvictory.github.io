<MudAlert Severity="Severity.Info">
    The web app is built in C# using Blazor and compiled to WebAssembly, which means computations are done on
    <i>client's side</i>, i.e. your browser, allowing for efficient implementation of the server. Therefore,
    excution speed may vary from machine to machine (mobile, PC, Mac...).
    <br /><br />
    For more information on WebAssembly, Google is your best friend, really.
